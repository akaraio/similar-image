# similar-image

This Streamlit app allows users to upload an image and then search for similar images within specified folders on their local machine. The app uses OpenCV and scikit-image to calculate the structural similarity index (SSIM) between the uploaded image and each relevant image in the search results, ranking them by their SSIM scores. The app displays the top-ranked similar images along with their corresponding SSIM scores as a percentage, allowing users to visualize and compare the similarities between images.
